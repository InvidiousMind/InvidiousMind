## ðŸŽ® Game Development

I specialize in crafting narrative-driven games that explore profound themes and complex characters. My current projects include:

- **Shattered Sunset**: Developed using Godot, this game delves into themes of death, the afterlife, and moral ambiguity, offering players a rich, atmospheric narrative with impactful choices.

- **Echoing Dawn**: A visual novel series created with Visual Novel Maker, chronicling the life of a lumberjack in the village of Ashwood. Spanning three books, it explores personal growth and village life, leading up to the events of *Shattered Sunset*.

## ðŸŽµ Music Production

Beyond game development, I produce music that complements my storytelling. You can listen to my playlists on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/invidiousmind/sets/spotify) and connect with me on [Minds](https://www.minds.com/Invidiousmind/).
